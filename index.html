      <h2 id="ready_to_die">Ready To Die</h2>

      <img src="images/biggie_baby.jpg" alt="Album Cover Art" title="GOAT Biggie Smalls with the most gangster song I've ever heard." width="427" height="600" />
      <!-- https://www.ebay.com/c/1744966826 -->

      <p>Yeah, yeah, you ready motherfucker?<br />
We gonna kill your ass
(I'm ready)<br />
As I grab the Glock, put it to your headpiece<br />
One in the chamber, the safety is off release<br />
Straight at your dome, homes, I wanna see cabbage<br />
Biggie Smalls the savage, doing your brain cells much damage<br />
Teflon is the material for the imperial<br />
Mic ripper, girl stripper, the Henny sipper<br />
I drop lyrics off and on like a lightswitch<br />
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive the Q<br />
45, Glocks and TEC are expected when I wreck shit<br />
Respect is collected, so check it<br />
I got techniques dripping out my buttcheeks<br />
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh<br />
My shit is deep, deeper than my grave, G<br />
I'm ready to die and nobody can save me<br />
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl<br />
My life is played out like a Jheri curl, I'm ready to die!<br /></p>

<p>As I sit back and look when I used to be a crook<br />
Doing whatever it took from snatching chains to pocketbooks<br />
A big bad motherfucker on the wrong road<br />
I got some drugs, tried to get the avenue sewed<br />
I want it all from the Rolex's to the Lexus<br />
Getting paid is all I expected<br />
My mother didn't give me what I want, what the fuck?<br />
Now I've got a Glock making motherfuckers duck<br />
Shit is real and hungry's how I feel<br />
I rob and steal because that money got that whip appeal<br />
Kicking niggas down the steps just for rep<br />
Any repercussion lead to niggas getting wet<br />
The infrared's at your head real steady<br />
You better grab your guns 'cause I'm ready<br />
I'm ready to die
(Yes, I'm ready)<br />
Nah we ain't gonna kill your ass yet, we gonna make you suffer<br />
(So die motherfuckers, die motherfuckers, die)<br /></p>

<p>In a sec, I throw the TEC to your fucking neck<br />
Everybody hit the deck, Biggie 'bout to get some rec'<br />
Quick to leave you in a coffin for slick talking<br />
You better act like CeCe and keep on walking<br />
When I hit ya, I split ya to the white meat<br />
You swung a left, you swung a right, you fell to the concrete<br />
Your face, my feet, they meet with stompin'<br />
I'm rippin' MCs from Tallahassee to Compton<br />
Biggie Smalls on a higher plane<br />
Niggas say I'm strange, deranged because I put the 12 gauge to your brain<br />
Make your shit splatter<br />
Mix the blood like batter then my pocket gets fatter<br />
After the hit, leave you on the street with your neck slit<br />
Down your backbone to where your motherfucking shit drip<br />
The shit I kick, ripping through the vest<br />
Biggie Smalls passing any test, I'm ready to die!<br />
I'm ready
(Yes, I'm ready)<br /></p>

      <!--https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xesqe7UML._SL1500_.jpg  -->

        <p>Can't you see I'm trying?<br />
I don't even like it<br />
I just lied to<br />
Get to your apartment<br />
Now I'm staying<br />
There just for a while<br />
I can't think 'cause<br />
I'm just way too tired<br /></p>

<p>Is this it?<br />
Is this it?<br />
Is this it?<br /></p>

<p>Said they'd give you anything you ever wanted<br />
When they lied, I knew it was just stable children<br />
Trying hard not to realize<br />
I was sitting right behind them<br />
Oh dear, can't you see? It's them it's not me<br />
We're not enemies<br />
We just disagree<br />
If I was like him, all pissed in this bar<br />
He changes his mind, says I went too far<br />
We all disagree<br />
I think we should disagree, yeah<br /></p>

<p>Is this it?<br />
Is this it?<br />
Is this it?<br /></p>

<p>Can't you see I'm trying?<br />
I don't even like it<br />
I just lied to<br />
Get to your apartment<br />
Now I'm staying<br />
There just for a while<br />
I can't think 'cause<br />
I'm just way too tired<br /></p>

<!-- https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61PkJ8LadXL.jpg -->

<p>Beeeware! Four figures appear through the fog<br />
Yeah! Gravediggaz cut like swords... rrRRRAAA!!<br />
Fear makes ya brain go numb<br />
You ain't, got a clue, where the Gods, come from<br />
I told myself to exist and then I flittle<br />
With millions of sperm cells and I found the eggggg<br />
Know I got my chance<br />
I came to enhance represent and get open as a bank<br /></p>

<p>Psychopathic, a deep theourassic<br />
Gravediggaz are massive, puttin niggaz in caskets<br />
Blowin like the wind, when I'm in my spin<br />
ya got fucked cross the path of the twister<br />
You face the storm and bring it onnnnn<br />
and get chopped in the blocks from Hitchcock<br />
The birds, my mental ward is my brainstorm<br />
Somehow I flipped and came equipped with a chainsaw<br /></p>

<p>Diggin graves see, pays my rent for the day<br />
Some hate the image that I must portray<br />
Critics, say "Go to hell" I say "Yeah,<br />
stupid motherfucker I'm already there!"<br />
Fru-strated, mentally aggravated<br />
to be the rebel that society created<br />
I'm good most times but when I'm foul then I'm flagrant<br />
Livin in the shadows like a government agent<br /></p>

<p>Ummm, one side of the story<br />
Shit cooked up from Gravediggaz laboratory<br />
Transformin brains with remains of a slug<br />
With the Undertaker makin beats that's buuuuuugged<br />
Path we creatin<br />
Splittin G's, choppin necks with the fat guillotines<br />
I'm your nightmare, fright with verse, one verse<br />
Will put your ass in my black hearse<br /></p>

<p>Ryza-rector, ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha
Hooah, hooah, hooah, hoo!<br />
Danger, enter the graveyard, chamber<br />
It's like, diggin, in yer EAR, with a hanger<br />
I inject my poison stinger, into your finger<br />
Of all your life forces, I'll take ya<br />
I'm blood, thirsty, thirsty for sure<br />
About to bloodsuck the same ones, who bloodsuck the poor<br />
You're, not safe, anymore<br />
To all the holy spooks, I declare war<br />
I'll, gravedig them up from hell, ryzarect them<br />
From the poisonous bones of swine, I disinfect them<br />
Positive Energy Activates, Constant Elevation<br />
Positive Energy Activates, Constant Elevation<br /></p>

<p>Out of the darkness<br />
Out of the deep of the darkness<br />
Lies the Gravediggaz<br />
from the parts unknown<br />
The world that's unknown<br />
People fear what they don't understand<br />
So, this is why we're here<br />
To explain that there's nothin to be afraid of<br />
Have no fear, Gravediggaz are here<br /></p>

<!-- https://t2.genius.com/unsafe/440x440/https%3A%2F%2Fimages.genius.com%2Fcb424e16950ebdbc96084cac89064c61.1000x1000x1.jpg -->

<p>I flips down the Ave<br />
Know I'm looking good<br />
I'm banging "Screw", nigga<br />
Diamonds up against that wood<br /></p>

<p>I flip down the Ave., you know I'm looking tight<br />
These jealous niggas looking at me and my car so shife<br />
Wanna take my life, and wanna jack, but I see all through that<br />
Never let these bitch niggas take what's mine, nigga never do that<br />
Who say he going through a thang, when y'all ain't never lied<br />
I gotta baby, but his mama act like he ain't mine<br />
Wicked women, using children to live on<br />
Wanna hurt and try to hate, 'cause she know the thrill is gone<br />
Say man, I stopped smoking wit' haters back in ninety-four<br />
But niggas thinking that a Sweet gong get him through my door<br />
But niggas talk alotta shit, in a safe place<br />
I know 'cause he can't look me eye-to-eye when he in my face<br />
Now nigga listen to my beats, and see just what I mean<br />
Nigga I ride dirty everyday, but still I shine so clean<br />
Glitter and gleam, ain't all what it look like<br />
So I keep swanging, out here clanging tryna live my life<br /></p>

<p>I flips down the Ave<br />
Know I'm looking good<br />
I'm banging "Screw", nigga<br />
Diamonds up against that wood<br /></p>

<p>I see these niggas and days, go and come<br />
And for me, just to wake, I know I'm blessed<br />
I grab my 'ses and split my Swisher wit' my thumb<br />
Some of my Sweets be tight, now some of my Sweets be fucked up<br />
But all of my Sweets gon' blow, so killa' smoke get sucked up<br />
I lucked today and didn't fall prey to none of that pistol play<br />
But who is to say, tomorrow they won't be blasting this-a-way<br />
I'm puffin' spliff's of hay, still upset about the drama here<br />
At this time of year, I'm wiping away my dead homies mama tears (Shit)<br />
But naturally, them fucking laws was always after me<br />
So I have to be, in that manor on that five-oh-three<br />
I'm living dastardly, must be all about survival 'g<br />
These niggas passing me, streets just keep on getting live wit' me<br />
They said there has to be another way, but I ain't feeling that<br />
They tried to steal a Lac, and my wig, they wanna peel it back<br />
But still the fact remains, it's all about the 'cain<br />
"Swang and Bang", peace to ESG and all the victims of the game, mang<br /></p>

<p>I flips down the Ave<br />
Know I'm looking good<br />
I'm banging "Screw", nigga<br />
Diamonds up against that wood<br /></p>

<p>Flipping through the Ave, tryna see some good<br />
But everythang is still the same, in my neighborhood<br />
Niggas frown when you up, and smile when you down<br />
And when you change for the better, shife fools stop coming around<br />
I see the jealousy and hating and the wicked ways<br />
We all lost children, praisin' paper, smoking our life away<br />
Got to the point where I could not decipher day from night<br />
She say she love me, but all we do now is fuck and fight<br />
My conscience fuck wit' me so much that I can't eat or sleep<br />
The other side of selling dope and out there running the streets<br />
And even though I'm gaining street fame, coming from this rap game<br />
Lustful thinking and compulsive drinking is a normal thang<br />
Some get erased and misplaced, trying to win the race<br />
Some try to hold on to they place, by smoking wit' lace<br />
But see drugs and plastic thugs ain't gon' change the hood<br />
I'm smoking skunk and popping the trunk to make me feel good<br /></p>

<p>I flips down the Ave<br />
Know I'm looking good<br />
I'm banging "Screw", nigga<br />
Diamonds up against that wood<br />
Diamonds up against that wood, so is your life<br /></p>

<p>Get thee behind me, Satan<br />
I want to resist<br />
But the moon is low and I can't say "No"<br />
Get thee behind me<br /></p>

<p>Get thee behind me, Satan<br />
I mustn't be kissed<br />
But the moon is low and I may let go<br />
Get thee behind me<br /></p>

<p>Someone I'm mad about<br />
Is waiting in the night for me<br />
Someone that I mustn't see<br />
Satan, get thee behind me<br /></p>

<p>He promised to wait<br />
But I won't appear and he may come here<br />
Satan, he's at my gate<br />
Get thee behind me<br />
Stay where you are<br />
It's too late<br /></p>

<p>Dirty belly of a secret town<br />
Cheap trick hookers that are hanging out at the bar<br />
In the Greyhound station<br />
And the bare-chested boys are going down<br />
On every thing that the momma believes<br />
Pack of smokes and a little bump of cocaine<br />
Help you feel not so strange<br /></p>

<p>Said old Pa, she don't get off, unless somebody standing near her<br />
And she'll shine, once she's crossed the line<br />
'Cause all tied to the chair<br />
I said, lay it now on the ground, throw in a white noise sound<br />
Like a tranny on a ten<br /></p>

<p>All the bubbas got their heads in a nod<br />
They don't know what they love or deserve to get<br />
Chances are they tab their worm in a slab<br />
Doesn't even know which fish that he like to bite tonight<br />
ah tonight, tonight, tonight<br />
Ah maybe tonight<br /></p>

<p>Said old Pa, she don't get off, unless somebody standing near her<br />
And she'll shine, once she's crossed the line<br />
Hands all tied to the chair<br />
I said, lay it now on the ground, throw in a white noise sound<br />
Like a tranny on a ten<br />
Comes home on call, isn't that the peace<br />
Fingers in the dirt, and he's spitting out his teeth<br />
Spitting out his teeth<br />
Comes home on call, isn't that the peace<br />
Fingers in the dirt, and he's spitting out his teeth<br />
Said old Pa, she don't get off, unless somebody standing near her<br />
And she'll shine, once she's crossed the line<br />
Hands all tied to the chair<br /></p>

<p>I said, lay it on the ground, throw in a white noise sound<br />
Like a tranny on a ten<br />
I said, lay it on the ground, throw in a white noise sound<br />
Like a tranny on a ten<br />
I said, lay it on the ground, throw in a white noise sound<br />
Like a tranny on a ten<br />
I said, lay it on the ground, throw in a white noise sound<br />

<p>Technique is ill son, watch how I spill one<br />
Peace to Biggie, 2Pac, Big L and Big Pun<br />
Havoc on the streets of Staten, snitches<br />
House niggas, children watch as they produce the same pattern<br />
Somebody raped our women, murdered our babies<br />
Hit us with the cracks and guns in the early 80's<br />
For those that murdered me shall stand before God<br />
To fall at the hands of fate, then out comes the rod<br />
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back<br />
What the fuck is going on, I can't go to sleep<br />
Feds jumping out their jeeps, I can't go to sleep<br />
Babies with flies on they cheeks, it's hard to go to sleep<br />
Ish bowled two 6's twice, I couldn't go to sleep<br />
Aiyyo we deep in the stairs, we carry big guns<br />
Whippy got hit up with the big shit, bong bong<br />
Stop at the cheeba spot, then pass the leak spot<br />
Drove past y'all niggas again, you took a cheap shot<br />
Not knowing, fucking with me you get your meat chopped<br />
You thought we fell on our face, you need to be stopped<br />
Call on the chariots, call on an ambulance<br />
You better smile, my nigga you on Candid Cam<br />
Gangsta broad, these be the laws, walk with big balls<br />
Nigga, motherfucking eunuch, I even take which was yours<br />
I'm the nigga that made you, man<br />
When your rap wasn't doing well I'm the nigga that gave you a hand<br /></p>

<p>Don't kill your brother, learn to love each other<br />
Don't get mad, cause it ain't that bad<br />
Look at who you are, you've come too far<br />
It's in your hands, just be a man<br />
Get the jelly out your spine<br />
Cobwebs out of your mind<br /></p>

<p>I can't go to sleep, I can't shut my eyes<br />
They shot the father at his mom's building seven times<br />
They shot Malcolm in the chest, front of his little seeds<br />
Jesse watched as they shot King on the balcony<br />
Exported Marcus Garvey cause he tried to spark us<br />
With the knowledge of ourselves and our forefathers<br />
Oh Jacqueline you heard the rifle shots crackling<br />
Her husband's head in her hands, you tried to put it back in<br />
America's watching, blood-stained ink blotches<br />
Medgar took one to the skull for integrating college<br />
What's the science? Somebody? This is trick knowledge<br />
They try to keep us enslaved and still scrape for dollars<br />
Walking through Park Hill, drunk as a fuck<br />
Looking around like these Devils<br />
I'm ready to break this world down<br />
They got me trapped up in a metal gate<br />
Just stressed out with hate<br />
And just give me no time to relax and use my mind to meditate<br />
What should I do, grab a blunt or a brew<br />
Grab a .22 and run out there and put this fucking violence in you<br />
I can't go to sleep, I can't shut em, son.. I<br /></p>

<p>The power is in your hands<br />
Stop all this crying and be a man<br /></p>

<p>Well we're back in school again<br />
And I don't really know anyone<br />
I really want to be your friend<br />
Cause I don't really know anyone<br /></p>

<p>And the bus is pulling<br />
Up to your house<br />
I wish you could be sitting here<br />
Next to me<br /></p>

<p>I didn't see you at summer school<br />
But I saw you at the corner store<br />
And I don't want to break the rules<br />
Cause I've broken them all before<br /></p>

<p>But every time I see you<br />
I wonder why<br />
I don't break a couple rules<br />
So that you'll notice me<br /></p>

<p>Sister do you know my name?<br />
I've heard it before but I want to know<br />
I got a funny feeling<br />
That it's gonna work out<br /></p>

<p>Cause now I see you sitting here
Next to me</p>

<br />

<p>You lack the minerals and vitamins, irons and the niacin<br />
Fuck who that I offend, rappers sit back I'm bout to begin<br />
Bout foul talk you sqwak, never even walked the walk<br />
More less destined to get tested, never been arrested<br />
My album will manifest many things that I saw did or heard about<br />
Or told first hand, never word of mouth<br />
What's in the future for the fusion in the changer?<br />
Rappers are in danger, who will use wits to be a remainder<br />
When the missile is aimed, to blow you out of the frame<br />
Some will keep their limbs and, some will be maimed<br />
The same suckers with the gab about, killer instincts<br />
But turned bitch and knowin' damn well they lack<br />
In this division the connoisseur, crackin' your head with a 4 by 4<br />
Realize sucka, I be the comin' like Noah<br />
Always sendin' you down, perpetratin' facadin' what you consider<br />
A image, to me this is, just a scrimmage<br />
I'm feel I'm stone, not cause I bop or wear my cap cocked<br />
The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock<br />
Those who pose lyrical but really ain't true I feel<br /></p>

<p>Their time's limited, hard rocks too<br /></p>

<p>Speakin' in tongues, about what you did but you never done it<br />
Admit you bit it cause the next man gained platinum behind it<br />
I find it ironic, so I researched and analyzed<br />
Most write about stuff they fantasized<br />
I'm fed up with the bull, on this focus of weed and clips<br />
And glocks gettin' cocked, and wax not bein' flipped<br />
It's the same old same old just strain it from the anal<br />
The contact, is not com-pexed or vexed<br />
So why you puhsin' it? Why you lyin' for? I know where you live<br />
I know your folks, you was a sucka as a kid<br />
Your persona's drama, that you acquired in high school in actin' class<br />
Your whole aura is plexi-glass<br />
What's-her-face told me you shot this kid last week in the park<br />
That's a lie, you was in church with your moms<br />
See I know yo, slow your roll, give a good to go<br />
Guys be lackin' in this thing called rappin' just for dough<br />
Of course we gotta pay rent, so money connects, but uh<br />
I'd rather be broke and have a whole lot of respect<br />
It's the principal of it, I get a rush when I bust<br />
Some dope lines oral, that maybe somebody'll quote<br />
That's what I consider real, in this field of music<br />
Instead of puttin' brain cells to work they abuse it<br />
Non-conceptual, non-exceptional<br />
Everybody's either crime-related or sexual<br />
I'm here to make a difference, besides all the riffin'<br />
The traps are not stickin', rappers stop flippin'<br />
For those who pose lyrical but really ain't true I feel<br /></p>

<p>Their time's limited, hard rocks too</p>
